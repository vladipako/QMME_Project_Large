# Transfer Entropy Project

This work pursues the goal of creating an open-source implementation of transfer entropy methodology based on Shannon entropy concept. RÃ©nyi entropy might potentially be added later. 

A Python based implementation of the Transfer Entropy method. 

Shall include:

1. A standard cumulative TE implementation, similar to RTransferEntropy by Dr. Dimpfl.
2. A PCF-like individual lag TE implementation for each lag in any direction of dependence.
3. Shuffle based p-value test, incorporating parallelisation to the extent allowed by hardware.
4. Calibration and comparisons to CopulaEntropy python package and RTransferEntropy R package.
5. A multi-dimensional processor for an input dataframe.
6. Graph model visualisation based on specific inputs.
7. ?..
